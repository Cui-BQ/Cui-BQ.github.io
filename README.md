## CSE 455 Final project report ##
I originally intended to improve the accuracy of a [picture classification from my CSE473 AI class project](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse473/22wi/assignments/hw5/index.html). But I laterly thought I should try something new. Thus, I took some code from this picture classification project to do the Kaggle Bird classification project. 

In this project, I used Pytorch and Deep CNN to do the classification work. Since this dataset didnâ€™t contain test data, I used 90% of the train data to train the CNN model and 10% to test the CNN model. 
So the procedure of my code is, first extra data from the original dataset and make them to Pytorch Dataset, then use Pytorch DateLoader to load into batch size = 128. Then train the train data for 10 times while valid the test data after each train to see how the accuracy improved and if overfitting. I copied the train part from the CSE473 AI project and the rest of the bird classification project is my own work.

For this project, I first made a DeepCNN model with three Conv filters by myself, and trained on this model:

    class DeepCNN(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, arr=[]):
            super(DeepCNN, self).__init__()
            
            self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 3)           
            self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 12, 3)          
            self.conv3 = nn.Conv2d(12, 24, 3)         
            self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2)
            self.fc2 = nn.Linear(16224, 555)       

        def forward(self, x):
            x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
            x = self.pool(x)
            x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
            x = self.pool(x)
            x = F.relu(self.conv3(x))

            x = self.pool(x)
            x = torch.flatten(x, 1) # flatten all dimensions except batch
            #x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
            x = self.fc2(x)
            return x
However, my CNN model was highly overfitted and the accuracy for both training and testing were low.

## Markdown plus h2 with a custom ID ##         {#id-goes-here}
[Link back to H2](#id-goes-here)

This is a paragraph, which is text surrounded by whitespace. Paragraphs can be on one 
line (or many), and can drone on for hours.  

Here is a Markdown link to [Warped](http://warpedvisions.org), and a literal . 
Now some SimpleLinks, like one to [google] (automagically links to are-you-
feeling-lucky), a [wiki: test] link to a Wikipedia page, and a link to 
[foldoc: CPU]s at foldoc.  

Now some inline markup like _italics_,  **bold**, and `code()`. Note that underscores in 
words are ignored in Markdown Extra.

![picture alt](/images/photo.jpeg "Title is optional")     

> Blockquotes are like quoted text in email replies
>> And, they can be nested

* Bullet lists are easy too
- Another one
+ Another one

1. A numbered list
2. Which is numbered
3. With periods and a space

And now some code:

    // Code is just text indented a bit
    which(is_easy) to_remember();

~~~

// Markdown extra adds un-indented code blocks too

if (this_is_more_code == true && !indented) {
    // tild wrapped code blocks, also not indented
}

~~~

Text with  
two trailing spaces  
(on the right)  
can be used  
for things like poems  

### Horizontal rules

* * * *
****
--------------------------


<div class="custom-class" markdown="1">
This is a div wrapping some Markdown plus.  Without the DIV attribute, it ignores the 
block. 
</div>

## Markdown plus tables ##

| Header | Header | Right  |
| ------ | ------ | -----: |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $10  |
|  Cell  |  Cell  |   $20  |

* Outer pipes on tables are optional
* Colon used for alignment (right versus left)

## Markdown plus definition lists ##

Bottled water
: $ 1.25
: $ 1.55 (Large)

Milk
Pop
: $ 1.75

* Multiple definitions and terms are possible
* Definitions can include multiple paragraphs too

*[ABBR]: Markdown plus abbreviations (produces an <abbr> tag)
